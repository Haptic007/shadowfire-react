# ⚡ Shadowfire React  
**Shadowfire Resilience Engine | Day 1**  
*A fusion of logic, psychology, and design.*

---

## ⚙️ Overview
This project powers the **Shadowfire Resilience Engine (SRE)** — a React-based framework for emotional-algorithmic growth, adaptive feedback, and resilience modeling.

Every component encodes one of the **nine external nodes of resilience**, governed by three internal harmonics:

**External Nodes:**  
Pressure • Acknowledgement • Radical Acceptance • Radical Honesty • Introspection • Self-Reflection • Perception • Action • Continuity  

**Internal Harmonics:**  
Shadow • Humor • Forgiveness  
These harmonics modulate each loop within the engine — linking contradictions, collapse, and ascension cycles into adaptive growth.
